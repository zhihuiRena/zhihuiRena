Blend Conf was:

> A generalist conference featuring 50 diverse speakers sharing ideas and conversations about user experience, design, and web development.

I had an absolute blast. While I don't maintain this many side projects anymore, I encourage you to visit my current side project: *[The Bold Report](https://theboldreport.net)*.
